# 🎮 Mini Project — One Concept, Three Technologies  
# Snake  , Water and Gun
### *A Creative Journey Through C, Python, and Tkinter GUI*  
##### 👨‍💻 Created by **Dhruv**

## 🌟 Project Overview

While learning **C** and **Python**, I wanted to build something that’s not only simple but also exciting.  
That’s how this **Mini Project** was born — a single concept implemented using **three different technologies**.

I started with a **console-based number guessing game** in C, recreated it in Python,  
and finally made it **more engaging** by adding a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** with Tkinter.  

This project reflects my curiosity, creativity, and passion for learning —  
how a basic idea can evolve into a multi-technology project when you code with joy 💡💻

## 🧠 What’s Inside

| File Name | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| `main.c` | Console-based Number Guessing Game in C |
| `main.py` | Console-based Number Guessing Game in Python |
| `main_tkinter.py` | GUI-based Number Guessing Game using Python Tkinter |

## 🕹️ How It Works

- The program randomly generates a number between **1 and 100**.  
- You enter your guess and receive feedback:  
  - **Too High 📈**, **Too Low 📉**, or **Correct 🎉**.  
- The GUI version adds buttons, labels, and colors for better user interaction.

## ✨ Features

- Three implementations of the same logic (C, Python, Tkinter GUI)  
- Simple, fun, and beginner-friendly  
- GUI interface for interactive experience  
- Clean code with meaningful comments  
- Shows logical thinking + creative design approach

## 🚀 How to Run

### ▶️ C Version
```
gcc main.c -o main
./main
```
### ▶️ Python Console Version
```
python main.py
```

### ▶️ Python GUI Version
```
python main_tkinter.py
```

## 💡 What I Learned

- Core logic & loops in C
- Simplicity & flexibility of Python
- Basics of GUI programming using Tkinter
- Handling user input & random number generation
- Thinking across multiple languages and paradigms

## 🎉 Fun Fact

This project started as a small “learning experiment,”
but soon became something that truly reflected my growth as a programmer.
From typing in the terminal ➜ to designing a GUI — every step was full of fun, debugging, and discovery!

## 🧩 Future Improvements
- Add difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Keep score & leaderboard system
- Add sound or animation to GUI version
- Integrate with a small web interface later using Flask
